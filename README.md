This is some simple code to generate random bingo boards for Drawception games.

The code here reads from a file at `boards/{boardname}.txt` determined by the query string. Feel free to edit these or create new ones; each space on the board should be on a separate line. If you have more than 25, then the generator will pick 25 from the pool at random.
