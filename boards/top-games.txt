Commenters saying that the game is awesome and "needs" to get top
Someone comments on how it's their first top game
Prompt mentions top games
Draw first
PIO prompt
Prompt contains "free draw" or "use all 10 minutes"
At least one panel by Death by Squeegee
Artist of first drawing is level 60 or higher
Least XP for any panel is 15 or more
These ones I might reuse for other boards:
One panel gets twice as many likes (bonus XP and base XP don't count) as any other panel
One panel gets 4x as much XP (bonus XP and base XP count) as any other panel
Prompt blatantly copies a previous top game in an attempt to reach top itself
5+ panels that contain memes, 3+ unique memes throughout all panels
Caption that earns more XP than the drawing they were captioning
The prompt references a specific meme
Some obnoxious meme that recently appeared on Drawception is in any panel
Captions go nowhere (PIO games don't count)
Any theme other than the default is applied
24-person game
Blitz mode
Prompt contains a pun
Someone obviously missed a reference
You remember skipping one or more of the captions
You remember skipping one or more of the drawings
Derailed PIO, step-by-step-guide, or continue-the-song
